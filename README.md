# Python Week 4 Assignment: File & Exception Handling

##  Files in this repo
- `file_challenge.py` → Reads a file (`input.txt`), modifies its content, and writes to `output.txt`.
- `error_handling_lab.py` → Asks the user for a filename and handles errors (e.g., file not found).

##  How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. For `file_challenge.py`:
   - Create an `input.txt` file with some text.
   - Run: `python file_challenge.py`
   - Check `output.txt` for the modified content.
3. For `error_handling_lab.py`:
   - Run: `python error_handling_lab.py`
   - Enter a filename when prompted.
   - The program will display the file’s contents or show an error message if the file doesn’t exist.

##  Outcomes
By completing this assignment, I practiced:
- Reading, writing, and appending files in Python.
- Using `try/except/finally` for robust error handling.
